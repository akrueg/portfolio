###CV

I am a freelance audio editor, a former middle school English teacher,
and before that a Visual Basic programmer.  I am currently researching 
front-end (and some back-end) web development and seeking a position in 
which I can use and develop these skills, ideally in helping / 
people-oriented field.

Strengths:

- fluent in js, css, html, markdown

- developing skills in node.js, linux administration, sh scripting,
  handlebars / liquid templating, svg, git

- passion for learning, teaching, reading, & writing

- math & science background, with a degree in biochemistry

- I care about building relationships with coworkers and clients.

###Sample 1: [Analysis of Touch Events](https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_touch/touch)

This is a diagnostic tool designed to help me learn about the
event-driven touchscreen behavior.  If the user touches the main 
green `<div>`, it reports details on the touch events and 
synthetic mouse events triggered, followed by some analysis / 
observations about touchscreen behavior.

____Skills demonstrated:____ My work so far has a technical / academic
focus, but it demonstrates the following skills that will be valuable 
in many professional / commercial settings:

- touch-based app programming

- eagerness to tackle and master technical challenges at their deepest
  level

- sophisticated js including event handlers, callbacks, closure, regexes,
  dom & stylesheet manipulation, and es6 syntax
  
- clean, commented code
  
- use of media queries, markdown, disclosure triangles, and other 
  formatting to present a large amount of information in a clean, 
  readable format that looks good on a mobile device or desktop

- ability to speak and write clearly and correctly (though some typos
  may have slipped through!)

- passion for explaining difficult subjects (see especially next sample)
  through clear logic, hands-on examples, color, humor, and 10 years' 
  experience as a teacher

[4](https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline4)** <meta i='inlineLinks'>

This series examines how the browser implements line & inline boxes, 
line-height, em size, vertical-align, and other details of text rendering.
It relies on several technical strategies including

- use of FontForge to design fonts with experimental metrics and a 
  custom glyph

- base64-encoded fonts and graphics

- use of svg to highlight parts of characters


###Sample 3: [Flexbox Popup](https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_flex/flex)

I'm including this page mainly for its friendlier feel, compared to 
the more academic style of the other samples.  This was one of my
early projects, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to
implement the clickable, scalable, light-up svg-map; then I fell off a 
cliff of css madness trying to accomplish vertical centering (of the popup), 
until I got to know flexboxes.
