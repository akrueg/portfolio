<h2>Resume &amp; Web Portfolio of <em>Andy Krueger</em>{#spanMyName}</h2>

<p>I developed the samples below using CodePen (and Cloud9 for 
Sample 3) as educational projects, to help me learn about / 
experiment with various aspects of front-end (and some back-end)
web development.  They were developed in <em>Chromium</em>{green!} &amp; <em>Firefox</em>{green!}
on a Linux (Ubuntu) desktop and <em>Chrome for Android</em>{green!} 
on a Samsung phone; I haven&#39;t yet been able to work on them in <em>Safari</em>{red} 
or <em>IE / Edge</em>{red}.</p>

<h3>Sample 1: <a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_touch/touch">Analysis of touch events</a></h3>

<p>This page is a tool for inspecting the browser&#39;s touch-event behavior.
If you touch the main green <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, it reports details on the 
touch events and synthetic mouse events triggered, below which
is some analysis.  The page uses a combination of MarkDown and 
disclosure triangles to communicate a lot of information in a clean, 
readable format that looks good on a mobile or desktop screen.</p>

<h3>Sample 2: <a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline1">Inline formatting, part&nbsp;1</a></h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline21">Part 2.1</a>
<a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline22">2.2</a>
<a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline23">2.3</a>
<a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline31">3.1</a>
<a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline32">3.2</a>
<a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline33">3.3</a>
<a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_inline/inline4">4</a></strong> <meta i='inlineLinks'></p>

<p>This series examines how the browser implements line &amp; inline boxes, 
line-height, em size, vertical-align, and other details of text rendering.
It relies on several technical strategies including</p>

<ul>
<li><p>use of FontForge to design fonts with experimental metrics and a 
custom glyph</p></li>
<li><p>base64-encoded fonts and graphics</p></li>
<li><p>use of svg to highlight parts of characters</p></li>
<li><p>a series of interactive demos.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample 3: <a href="https://akrueg.github.io/portfolio/sample_flex/flex">Flexbox popup</a></h3>

<p>I&#39;m including this page mainly for its friendlier feel, compared to 
the more academic style of the other samples.  This was one of my
early projects, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to
implement the clickable, scalable, light-up svg-map; then I fell off a 
cliff of css madness trying to accomplish vertical centering (of the popup), 
until I got to know flexboxes.  </p>
